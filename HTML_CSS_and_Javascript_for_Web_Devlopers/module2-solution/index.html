                    The Spanish flu, also known as the 1918 flu pandemic, was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza A virus. Lasting more than 12 months from spring 1918 to early summer 1919. It infected 500 million people about a third of the world's population at the time. The death toll is estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in human history.

                <h2>Plague</h2>
                <p>
                    Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. The disease is transmitted between animals via their fleas and, as it is a zoonotic bacteriuma, it can also transmit from animals to humans. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials. Plague is found on all continents except Oceania but most human cases since the 1990s have occurred in Africa.
